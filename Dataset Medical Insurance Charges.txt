Dataset: Medical Insurance Charges


1. Dataset Overview

Total Records: 1338
Features: 7
Numerical Features: age, bmi, children, charges
Categorical Features: sex, smoker, region

2. Structure and Summary Statistics

Age: Ranges from 18 to 64 (mean ≈ 39.2).
BMI (Body Mass Index): Mean ≈ 30.7; presence of high-BMI individuals suggests obesity is prevalent.
Children: Majority have 0–2 children; max is 5.
Charges: Highly skewed — ranging from a few thousand to over $63,000. Indicates some patients incur very high costs (possibly due to chronic illness or smoking).

3. Data Cleaning

Missing Values: None (none in this particular dataset but code is there to handle them if present)
Duplicates: Removed if present
Outliers: Detected and removed using IQR method in all numerical features (especially visible in charges, bmi)
Standardization: All categorical values converted to lowercase and stripped of whitespace

4. Distribution Insights

Histograms
age: Slightly right-skewed; fairly uniform with more entries around 20-60 years.
bmi: Normal distribution but right tail is slightly heavy.
charges: Strong positive skew (a small % of people pay very high charges).
children: Mostly people have children less than equal to two.

Boxplots
Clear presence of outliers in charges and bmi before cleaning.
charges vary greatly, especially in smokers.

5. Correlation Analysis
Variable	Charges Correlation
age		~0.3 (Moderate)
bmi		~0.2 (Weak-Moderate)
children	~0.1 (Low)
smoker		Very strong impact (seen in pairplot, violin plots)
Strongest driver of charges is smoking status, visible in the heatmap and pairplots.

6. Scatter Plot Insights

Clear positive linear trend between age and charges for smokers.
For non-smokers, charges stay relatively moderate regardless of age.

7. Categorical Feature Analysis (Box & Violin Plots)

charges by sex:
No major difference in cost distribution between male and female.

charges by smoker:
Smokers incur drastically higher charges — distribution is wider and heavily skewed upward.

charges by region:
Slight variations; southeast region tends to have higher average charges.

8. Multivariate Analysis

Pairplot by smoker:
Clusters show how smokers stand out across bmi and charges.

Grouped Bar Plot (sex vs smoker vs charges):
Male smokers tend to have slightly higher average charges than female smokers.
Among non-smokers, the cost gap across sexes is minimal.

9. Heatmap of Region vs Sex
Highest average charges for female smokers in southeast region.
Charges tend to be higher in southeast across both sexes.

10. More Insights

Smoking is the dominant driver of medical charges.
Age and BMI have moderate influence on cost, especially for smokers.
Regional and gender differences exist, but are less significant than smoking.
Removing outliers makes visual trends more interpretable and reliable.
Distribution of charges is right-skewed, implying some policyholders are incurring extremely high costs (possible targets for insurance cost analysis or preventive care programs).
